The http Apache server is used to serve the webpage which is just a basic webpage using **Bootstrap**. No authentication has been implemented as the project is only meant for testing and demonstration purposes.

### Why PHP
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is known as a general-purpose scripting language that **can be used to develop dynamic and interactive websites**. It was among the first server-side languages that could be embedded into HTML, making it easier to add functionality to web pages without needing to call external files for data.

MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL â€“ Structured Query Language. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for mySQL however, is **for the purpose of a web database**.
